            <h3>Major</h3>
            <p>If you would have asked me a year ago about my career path, I would have told I wanted to be a therapist. I like the idea of helping people on a very personal level, and still do. But I love creating. That is why I really enjoy the Computer Information Systems degree. Everyday in any class I get to create something, and I really like that. My personal goals with this degree is to make an app and make my own website.</p>

            <p>I really hope that in my life I can be a part of something special. I dont care for being remembered but I would love to make something that would be used by people.</p>
